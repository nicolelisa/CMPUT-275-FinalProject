It’s a nice idea, go for it! 

Does OpenFlight have an open API to pull in flight information or are you going to manually extract this information for a predefined set of destinations? I’m also not quite sure why you take two inputs from the user; is it to solve the TSP problem once for every subset of size n from the original m destinations and compare their costs to find the lowest one? If so, you should be careful because if m choose n is large then it will be computationally expensive to find the solution.
